          <p>
            After years of studying biology and working as a molecular biology researcher, I decided
            to pivot to become a web developer. It‚Äôs been a journey with so much challenges, but I‚Äôm
            excited to learn more and gain new skills. I‚Äôm currently making a bunch of websites and
            looking for clients to work with.{' '}

          <h3 className="py-7 text-2xl font-bold leading-7">Coffe Chats</h3>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve been shying away from networking despite fully knowing the benefit of doing so. But
            after rereading Alexey‚Äôs post about making friends online and cold emailing, I mustered
            up my courage to finally sent that email I wrote months ago but didn‚Äôt dare to send. One
            email lead to another and more. It‚Äôs nerve wrecking but I‚Äôm excited! So if you know
            someone who‚Äôs currently working in tech as web developer, please kindly introduce me to
            them. I‚Äôll be delighted to have a virtual coffee chat with them ‚òïÔ∏è

          <h3 className="py-7 text-2xl font-bold leading-7">Language learning</h3>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm currently obsessed with Thai dramas and musics, and strive to learn the language to
            sing my favorite songs correctly and hopefully can enjoy the tv shows without subtitles.
            It‚Äôs been challenging because there is no space between words in Thai and each word can
            be read differently from left or right or up or bottom. To add onto it, Thai has five
            tones! Currently I know 17 consonants, 12 vowels, and 10-ish words, and getting super
            pumped adding new words on my Anki deck. I‚Äôll share the deck when I finish adding words
            on it, in case you‚Äôre also interested to learn Thai üòÑ

          <p>
            I want to continue writing and sharing ideas. I shoot for three posts a month but I
            don‚Äôt beat myself if I fail.

            , and many interesting people I found online. Nowadays I‚Äôm rereading posts from Alexey
            and Khatzumoto. I also find myself enjoying fictions more than I did for the last few
            years. Usually I opted for non-fictions every time I need inspiration or just chilling,
            but now I understand the charm of fictions and can appreciate it more.
