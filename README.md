# My 🏠 on the ☁️

My personal site on the cloud.

## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

Beyond technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a software engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment on what I wrote (still have to figure out how to enable comment, though 🙂).

## Stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.
