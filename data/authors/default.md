Hello, I'm Hazrina _(pronounced: haaz-ree-na)_, a research scientist turned full-stack web developer. 

After getting my Bachelor's degree in Biology, I worked as a research assistant conducting study and analyzing data about colorectal cancer detection. While analyzing data using R programming language (and a little bit of python), I was attracted to the fact that I can build things that solve problems through coding, so I started to learn building web apps in my spare time.

As I learn more and improve my skills in web development, I decided to become a full stack web developer to start a new phase. Taking advantage of all my research and data analysis experiences, I believe I can provide creative, structured, and efficient solutions through web applications.
