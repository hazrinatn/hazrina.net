# Welcome 🏡

One of the main reasons I decided to learn coding is to make my own blog. I want to upgrade from the high-school-student-vibe blogspot one, to one that I can rightfully call my own without depending on any blogging platform. I thought this was a rather simple project that I can whip out in one weekend, but I couldn’t be more wrong. It took me months to learn coding from scratch— from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, to finally learn React and use its framework to build a web-blog.

After several failed attempts (and questioning my life choice), I can now confidently welcome you to my home in the cloud. This is the place where my thoughts, ideas, and projects are compiled. It’s still far from perfect (still have to figure out how to enable comments on my posts), but it’s here, finally accessible to people all around the world. 

I built this web using Next.js featuring Tailwind CSS based on template made by Timothy Lin. And since I’m still learning to explain technical stuff in writing, you can directly check out Tim’s github repo [here](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) to learn more about the tech stacks behind this web. He explains it so well so it’s easy to understand and use. Thank you Tim!

So yeah, this is version 1 of my web portfolio/blog. Enjoy exploring!
